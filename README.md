building autonomous systems at [Vesper Dynamics](https://colonel1223.net). RL, edge deployment, alignment research.

San Jose ↔ Tokyo · [colonel1223.net](https://colonel1223.net)

most of my time right now goes to:
- real-time ML inference on edge hardware (quantization, pruning, latency optimization)
- hierarchical RL policies for embodied agents
- figuring out why alignment guarantees break at scale ([formal models](https://github.com/colonel1223/ai-alignment-research))

some things I've built:
- [learned-reranker](https://github.com/colonel1223/learned-reranker) — hybrid retrieval + neural re-ranking, +36% NDCG@10
- [conformal-multimodal](https://github.com/colonel1223/conformal-multimodal) — distribution-free uncertainty quantification
- [CHIMERA](https://github.com/colonel1223/CHIMERA) — 847K traces showing hallucination is information-theoretic
- [agentic-rag-diagnostics](https://github.com/colonel1223/agentic-rag-diagnostics) — closed-loop retrieval agent
